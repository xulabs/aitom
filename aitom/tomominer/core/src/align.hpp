    We calculate the constrained correlation coefficient (CCC) as defined by
    FÃ¶rster @cite forster_2008.

    A subtomogram is a volume over a grid with values defined for T_i(x,y,z).
    A simple normalization subtracts the mean, and divides by the standard
    deviation:

    \f[
    T_i'(x,y,z) = \frac{T_i(x,y,z) - \bar{T_i}}{\sqrt{\sum_{x,y,z}(T_i(x,y,z) - \bar{T_i})^2}}
    \f]

    The normalization between two tomograms is defined by their element-wise product.
    \f[
    cor(T_i, T_j) = \sum_{x,y,z}T_i'(x,y,z) \cdot T_j'(x,y,z) 
    \f]

    There are several complications with our data however.  First our tomograms
    are not complete data.  They are sampled from a Fourier space which is
    missing a wedge.  This incomplete sampling is described by the wedge shaped
    region \f$\omega_i\f$.

    For two tomograms with different wedges and which align after rotations, we
    restrict our correlation calculations to the region for which both
    tomograms have been defined.

    \f[
    \Omega_{ij} = R(-\psi_i, -\phi_i, -\theta_i) \cdot R(-\psi_j, -\phi_j, -\theta_j) 
    \f]

    Where \f$R(-\psi_i, -\phi_i, -\theta_i)\f$ is the inverse rotation of
    defined by Euler angles rotating around \f$(\psi_i, \phi_i, \theta_i)\f$

    Also included is a mask to restrict the portions of the tomograms compared.

    Our new normalized tomogram is then:

    \f[ T_i' = \frac{ M(x,y,z) \cdot \mbox{FFT}^{-1}(\hat{T}_i \cdot \Omega_{ij}) - \bar{T}_i)}{ \sqrt{\sum_{x,y,z} (M(x,y,z)\cdot \mbox{FFT}^{-1}(\hat{T}_i\cdot \Omega_{ij} - T_i'))^2 }} \f]

    where \f[\hat{T_i} = \mbox{FFT}(Rot_{-\psi_i, -\phi_i, -\theta_i}(T_i(x,y,z))) \f]

    and \f$\Omega_{ij}\f$ is the overlap of the Fourier coefficients from
    spectrum after accounting for missing wedge, and rotations.

    The mean value \f$\bar{T}\f$ also accounts for the mask and the rotational
    constraint:

    \f[\bar{T} = \frac{1}{\sum_{x,y,z} M(x,y,z)} \sum_{x,y,z} \mbox{FFT}^{-1}(\hat{T_i}\cdot\Omega_{ij}) \f]
    
    The cross correlation remains defined as: 

    \f[cor(T_i, T_j) = \sum_{x,y,z} T_i'(x,y,z) \cdot T_j'(x,y,z) \f]
    
    @subsection FFT nad alignment search.

    We want to search for the best alignment of two volumes \f$V_1\f$, and \f$V_2\f$.

    The score of displacement (i,j,k) is:
    
    \f[
    S(i,j,k) = \sum_{x,y,z} V_1(x+i,y+j,z+k) \cdot V_2(x,y,z) 
    \f]

    This calculation is expensive.  Instead use FFT to do correlation.
    
    \f[
    S = \mbox{real}( \mbox{FFT}^{-1} ( \mbox{FFT}(V_1) \cdot \overline{\mbox{FFT}(V_2)} ) )
    \f]

    Here the product is element wise, and the bar signifies the conjugate
    should be used.

    From this correlation score we determine the displacement with the largest
    score, and return that as well as the score S(i,j,k).

    First we normalize each subtomogram taking into account the missing wedge

/**
    Determine the correlation between two volumes, using their representations in
    spherical harmonic coefficients at the given radius values.

    For each radius, sample the volume at that distance from the center over
    the surface of a sphere, and then calculate the spherical harmonic
    representation.  This gives a set of coefficients for every distance r.
    (\f$Y_l^m(r)\f$).  These are then used to calculate a correlation.

    Define \f[I = \int_r Y_{1l}^{m_1}(r) Y_{2l}^{*m_{2}}(r) r^2 dr \f]

    \f$Y_{1l}^{m_{1}}(r)\f$ is the \f$(l,m_1)\f$ coefficient from the first volume,
    from radius \f$r\f$. \f$Y_{2l}^{*m_{2}}(r)\f$ is the \f$(l,m_2)\f$ coefficient from
    the second volume conjugated.

    \f$I\f$ is a set of matrices for each \f$l\f$.  Each matrix of \f$I_l\f$
    has entries for each \f$(m_1,m_2)\f$.

    The value at \f$I_l(m_1,m_2)\f$ is found by integrating the product of the
    spherical harmonics and \f$r^2\f$ over the range of r for which both
    \f$m_1\f$ and \f$m_2\f$ are defined.

    Once \f$I\f$ is defined we sum over \f$l\f$ and multiply by Wigner matrices
    and take an inverse FFT to get the correlation.
